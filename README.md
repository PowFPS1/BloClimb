# BloClimb Website 🧗‍♂️

Hey! Welcome to the source code for the official **BloClimb** website. 

This is the central hub for our Roblox bouldering community. It connects players to everything they need—whether that's jumping straight into the game, applying for a staff position, checking out the training schedule, or buying a rank.

## What's Inside?

We recently gave the site a big improvement!
- **Modern Look:** Dark mode, neon accents, and a much better layout.
- **Speedy:** It's static HTML/CSS so it loads super fast.
- **Mobile Friendly:** Looks great on your phone or your PC.

## Development
If you want to tweak something locally:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
